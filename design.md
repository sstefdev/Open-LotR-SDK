# Lord of the Rings SDK Design üë®‚Äçüé®

The Lord of the Rings SDK is designed to provide a convenient and easy-to-use interface for developers to access information about the Lord of the Rings trilogy from the Lord of the Rings API. The SDK abstracts the complexities of API calls and provides a simplified and consistent API for consuming movie and quote data.

## Architecture

The SDK follows a modular architecture to enhance maintainability and extensibility. It consists of the following components:

- API Layer: Handles communication with the Lord of the Rings API. It encapsulates the HTTP requests and responses using a library like Axios and provides functions for making API calls.
- Data Models: Define the structure of movie and quote data using TypeScript interfaces. These models ensure type safety and consistency throughout the SDK.
- SDK Functions: Provide a set of high-level functions that utilize the API layer to fetch movie and quote data. These functions abstract the underlying API calls and provide a simplified API for developers to use.
- Test Suite: Includes a comprehensive test suite using a testing framework like Jest. The tests cover different scenarios to ensure the correctness and reliability of the SDK.

## SDK Functions

The Lord of the Rings SDK provides the following functions to interact with the Lord of the Rings API:

- `getMovies(params?: QueryParams): Promise<Response>`: Fetches a list of movies. It accepts optional query parameters for pagination, filtering, and sorting.
- `getMovieById(id: string, params?: QueryParams): Promise<Movie | null>`: Retrieves a specific movie by its ID.
- `getMovieQuotes(id: string, params?: QueryParams): Promise<Response>`: Fetches quotes for a specific movie by its ID.
- `getQuotes(params?: QueryParams): Promise<Response>`: Retrieves a list of all quotes.
- `getQuoteById(id: string, params?: QueryParams): Promise<Quote | null>`: Retrieves a specific quote by its ID.

## Error Handling

The SDK handles errors in the following ways:

- API call errors: If an error occurs during an API call, the SDK will log an error message and return null or an empty array/object depending on the expected response. This allows developers to handle errors gracefully in their applications.
- Invalid or missing data: If the API response contains invalid or missing data, the SDK will still return the response but with appropriate values set to null or defaults. This ensures that the SDK remains robust even in scenarios where the API data is inconsistent.

## Extensibility

The Lord of the Rings SDK is designed with extensibility in mind. It can be easily extended to support additional endpoints or features from the Lord of the Rings API. New SDK functions can be added to interact with the API, and corresponding data models can be defined to ensure type safety.
